# Spotify-AI-powered-recommendation-project-management


Here's the revised description with more Spotify-specific details:

In our Project Management class, our six-member Project Management Organization (PMO) team worked on a project about a Spotify AI-Powered Recommendation System. Our goal was to design a system that could improve user experience on Spotify by delivering highly personalized music recommendations.

Project Charter: We developed a detailed project charter outlining our project’s purpose: to create an AI model that analyzes user behavior, such as listening history, favorite artists, and playlists, to recommend songs and playlists more accurately. The charter described our objectives, scope, key stakeholders, and success criteria, setting a clear direction for our team.

Project Kickoff: We conducted a project kickoff meeting where we shared our strategy for building the recommendation system. We discussed the project timeline, outlined each team member’s role (such as data analysis, AI model development, and user interface design), and set goals for creating a seamless user experience on Spotify. This kickoff ensured everyone understood their responsibilities and the overall project plan.

Risk Management: We identified several potential risks, such as issues with the quality and variety of user data affecting recommendation accuracy, challenges in tuning the AI algorithms, and the possibility of delays in system integration. To address these risks, we developed strategies like setting up data quality checks, creating backup plans for model adjustments, and holding regular status meetings to keep the project on track.

Work Breakdown Structure (WBS): We created a Work Breakdown Structure to break down the project into manageable tasks, such as collecting and cleaning Spotify user data, developing and training the AI recommendation model, and designing a user-friendly interface to display song recommendations. This structure helped us efficiently allocate resources and track progress from start to finish.

We explained everything through presentations as we had to present every other week for the class. Please check the presentations uploaded in this repository,
